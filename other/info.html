                <p>
                    The parents of Albert Einstein were middle-class, secular Jews. Hermann Einstein, his father, began his
                    career as a featherbed salesman and then successfully ran an electrochemical plant. The family home was
                    managed by his mother, Pauline Koch. Maria, his only sibling, was born two years after Albert and went
                    by the name Maja.
                    Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who later lived in the U.S. is regarded as one of the most
                    influential physicists of all time. He studied everything from motion and gravity theories to quantum
                    mechanics. Following the publication of a number of ground-breaking studies, Einstein traveled the globe
                    and delivered presentations about his findings. In 1903 Einstein married Milena Maric, a Serbian physics
                    student whom he had met at school in Zürich. They had three children: a daughter, named Lieserl, and two
                    sons, named Hans and Eduard. After a period of unrest, Einstein and Maric divorced in 1919. Einstein,
                    during his marriage, had begun an affair with his cousin Elsa Löwenthal. They were married in 1919, the
                    same year he divorced Maric.
