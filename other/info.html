                <h3>Background</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    The parents of Albert Einstein were middle-class, secular Jews. Hermann Einstein, his father, began
                    his
                    career as a featherbed salesman and then successfully ran an electrochemical plant. The family home
                    was
                    managed by his mother, Pauline Koch. Maria, his only sibling, was born two years after Albert and
                    went
                    by the name Maja.
                    Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who later lived in the U.S. is regarded as one of the
                    most
                    influential physicists of all time. He studied everything from motion and gravity theories to
                    quantum
                    mechanics. Following the publication of a number of ground-breaking studies, Einstein traveled the
                    globe
                    and delivered presentations about his findings. In 1903 Einstein married Milena Maric, a Serbian
                    physics
                    student whom he had met at school in Zurich. They had three children: a daughter, named Lieserl, and
                    two
                    sons, named Hans and Eduard. After a period of unrest, Einstein and Maric divorced in 1919.
                    Einstein,
                    during his marriage, had begun an affair with his cousin Elsa Lowenthal. They were married in 1919,
                    the
                    same year he divorced Maric.

                <p>While employed at a Swiss patent office during his "Miracle Year" in 1905, Einstein published four
                    significant papers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Max Planck, a German physicist, developed the quantum theory, which Einstein used to explain the
                        photoelectric phenomenon in his first publication. For this work, he went on to receive the
                        Nobel
                        Prize in 1921.</li>
                    <li>The first experimental evidence for the existence of atoms was shared in his second publication
                        using the Brownian motion, or the motion of microscopic particles suspended in liquid, according
                        to
                        Britannica. </li>
                    <li>In his third paper, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies," Einstein's special theory of
                        relativity was presented.</li>
                    <li>His fourth paper led to the most famous equation in science, E = mc2. According to this
                        equation,
                        mass and energy are essentially the same physical thing. Despite the fact that Einstein was
                        never
                        requested to join the American-led Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb, this
                        equation
                        and other theories of his contributed to its development.</li>
                    <li>Unified field theory, which uses a single theoretical framework to describe fundamental forces
                        and
                        the connections between elementary particles, was Einstein's final project, which was unfinished
                        when he passed away.</li>
                </ul>
